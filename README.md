# Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

## To-Do List

https://trello.com/b/SWRyP6Zr/android-project

This was the second project I completed at CodeClan (Week 9) where I created a To Do List app in Android using Java and SQLite3.

### Project Specification
You are required to write an Android app which will allow the user to maintain a task list. The user should be able to enter tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show the bare details of each task. Selecting a task from the list should bring up another screen which shows full details of the task.
Users should also be able to mark tasks as completed.
